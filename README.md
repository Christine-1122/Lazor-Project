  Adding 0 for half steps as in the instructions.
  
  

UNIT TEST:
--------------
- Time Elapsed and Iterations for each file and iterations.

  - For 'mad_1.bff' file:
  Iterations = 4375
  Time Elapsed = 0.06883692741394043 s

  - For 'mad_4.bff' file:
  Iterations = 64031
  Time Elapsed = 0.9391860961914062 s

  - For 'mad_7.bff' file:
  Iterations = 17402
  Time Elapsed = 0.45905303955078125 s

  - For 'numbered_6.bff' file:
  Iterations = 8027
  Time Elapsed = 0.13559293746948242 s
 
  - For 'yarn_5.bff' file:
  Iterations = 243313
  Time Elapsed = 5.374972820281982 s
  
  - For 'tiny_5.bff':
  Iterations = 2
  Time Elapsed = 0.0005657672882080078 s
